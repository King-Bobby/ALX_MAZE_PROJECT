<h1>ALX MAZE PROJECT<h1>
    This is my first time using SDL2 and raycasting. This project is just a simple 3d Maze which is easy to use and easy to navigate.
The 'Maze.exe' file is the compiled file which is the 3d Maze itself. However, if you want to compile the file by yourself, you can type:

	<i>g++ -I src/include -L src/lib -o Maze render.cpp main.cpp -lmingw32 -lSDL2main -lSDL2 -lSDL2-image<i>

Note: You can change the name 'Maze' to any name you want.

	Next is functionality,
    To move in the forward direction, left direction, backwards direction and right direction, use <b>w, a, s, d</b> respectively. You can also use your touchpad to rotate in any direction you want. Finally to exit, simply press <b>Alt+f4</b>. 
    It is quite simple and i am proud for this first steps. Hopefully subsequent games will be better and more complex.
